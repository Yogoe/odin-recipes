        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced onions</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) jar brown gravy (such as Heinz)</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>4 cups cooked rice</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Grease a large skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Divide ground chuck into four equal portions; form into patties.</li>
            <li>Fry patties in the hot skillet until they begin to firm, are hot, and are slightly pink in the center, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Remove patties to a plate, retaining drippings in the skillet.</li>
            <li>Stir onion and water into reserved drippings. Reduce heat to low and cook until onion is slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook and stir until mushrooms are cooked through, about 5 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Pour gravy over onion-mushroom mixture; stir. Cook until gravy is hot, about 5 minutes. Gently lie patties into gravy; simmer until reheated through.</li>
            <li>While patties simmer in gravy, grease a separate skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat. Fry eggs in the hot skillet until whites are opaque, but yolks remain runny, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide cooked rice between four plates. Top each rice portion with a beef patty and cover each patty with an egg. Pour gravy equally over each portion.</li>
        </ol>
